# Writing A C Compiler
My solution for Nora Sandlers 'Writing A C Compiler' book.

Just got everything up to chapter 9 passing tests including the extra credit components.
Little bit scrappy and here and there (stay out of the main file!) but had to rewrite this thing multiple times so never put too much effort into making anything pretty as it would just end up getting rewrote again and again...and again.
